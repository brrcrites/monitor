# Python Monitoring

## What is this?

This is a small program that I'm writing as practice for working with several DevOps related Python topics such as ...

* HTTP Requests
* File System Processing
* Regular Expressions
* Text Parsing
* Basic Langauge Constructors

## What does this mean for me?

It means you should only use this as a learning experience, hobby projects, or quick reference for doing specific things in python. This project doesn't have a primary (or secondary) concern about security, only minimal thought was given to scalability or efficiency, and it probably won't get much upkeep. *Please* don't use this in anything that even resembles a production environment.
